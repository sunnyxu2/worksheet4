I used the python file ws4stats.py to calculate the mean and variance.
To run it, first process the file so that it is only a list of numbers,
then do $python3 ws4stats.py <filename>

QUESTION 1:

I chose to study the top 3 customers and top 3 products as identified in Worksheet 3.

The results were:

Customer 50122160:
Mean: 6.128 upvotes
Variance: 110.725 upvotes^2

Customer 50732546:
Mean: 5.851 upvotes
Variance: 62.598 upvotes^2

Customer 52615377:
Mean: 28.087 upvotes
Variance: 3982.025 upvotes^2

Book ISBN 043935806X:
Mean: 1.567 upvotes
Variance: 88.304 upvotes^2

Book ISBN 0439139597:
Mean: 1.517 upvotes
Variance: 48.447 upvotes^2

Book ISBN 0525947647:
Mean: 11.562 upvotes
Variance: 1179.779 upvotes^2

Yes, means and variances of upvotes may differ greatly between different customers and products.
As seen with the top 3 customers, it appears that the top two have more consistently "helpful reviews,"
getting around 5-7 upvotes per review, but the number 3 customer's upvotes vary a lot more,
which suggests that their reviews' upvotes are not as consistent but sometimes receives a lot of upvotes.
As seen with the top 3 books, it appears that Harry Potter books differ from a book about lying.
The top two books, which are Harry Potter books, receive only an average of 1-2 upvotes, and don't veary by much.
This makes somewhat sense because reviews for fiction usually are about the subject of the literature,
rather than product specifications or performance. 
However, the number 3 book, titled "Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them," suggests that this book is more
of a guide book than literature, because it receives an average of about 11 upvotes and varies a lot. This makes
sense because if this book is indeed a guide book on liars, the reviews would likely be about how effective
the information was communicated.
A more thorough analysis of more books and customers may reveal more about the factors that result in
specific distributions of upvotes.
